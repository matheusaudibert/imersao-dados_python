This repository contains the project developed during Data Immersion with Python by Alura.
Throughout the immersion, we explored data analysis techniques using **Pandas** for manipulation and cleaning, as well as **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

The project also includes the creation of an interactive dashboard with Streamlit, allowing results to be presented in a dynamic and accessible way.
